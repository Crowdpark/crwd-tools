crwd-tools (formerly known as bash-pm)
==========

Every Developer at Crowdpark just need a github account and the github project url to fetch the project. Also cpFetch tries to read the project configuration to configure the local apache and other services to make it possible for non shell junkies to work on projects easier.

**Install & Setup**

	$ curl https://raw.github.com/Crowdpark/crwd-tools/master/install.sh | sh

If not already created, this will create the std. project folder www in your home directory and then clones the crwd-tools into your project folder. Afterwards the local setup will be done.

**Usage**

There are several tools. Please read the individual README files.

**TODO list**

--- offer this as a brew recipe.

--- automated environment setup: mysql, etc...
