If you don't know about your system I'll try to give you some entry points:

1.) Brew

Brew is a package managar which provides the most easy and elegant way (at the moment) to install *NIX packages on OSX.

2.) Nginx & php-fpm

Nginx and php-fpm (php in general) configs can be found in /usr/local/etc, if you use the brew versions (which I would strongly recommend).

3.) Crowdpark Projects

Crowdpark projects has to be placed in ~/www/projectname, ~ is the common shortcut for the path to your homedir, you can also use $HOME. Try out 'ls -la $HOME', 'ls -la ~' or 'cd ~; pwd'

Follow the instructions in the README.md to setup your system:
